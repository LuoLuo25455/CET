## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
This project is named Treasure Hunt Game, with the goal of having the pirate win the game at 100%. For this project, it started with a Deep Q Learning algorithm that the model can perform trial-and-errors from based on the number of epochs. The end goal for building such model is to having the pirate reach a 100% win rate to obtain the treasure. The part of the code I created myself was the Deep Q Learning part, with parameters and factors adjusted for the most optimal outcome.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
- Computer scientists are not just programmers but analyzers and promoters of novel ideas. Usually, such novel ideas come from the need due to higher external demand, then based on computer scientists' analysis, such idea will be materialized into an actual project.
- This logic matters because this is how we have progressed from basic command lines like Linux to artifical intelligence. With more people are using what's currently available, the demand for some better gets bigger and bigger, which promote for future technological development.
  
### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
- Careful scrunity of whether the problem is worth investigating
- Detailed research on useful topics
- Thorough discussions with other computer scientists
- Meaningful and practical plan for materialization
- Close collaboration with other computer scientists to deliver the final product

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
- Ensure the end user's data does not get breached
- Prevent external attacks from getting into end user's database
- With AI, make sure that such AI does not dominate the decision makers in the organization but more as a tool to facilitate
